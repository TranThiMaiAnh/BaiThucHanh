        <h2>Viet Nam</h2>
        <p>The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, widely known as Vietnam, is not a strange name to the whole world. Although this country is ravaged by a series of wars which cause serious damages, Vietnam in the eyes of the world is nice and peaceful. Vietnam is located in the eastern Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia, with Hanoi as its capital.</p>
